# Jenkins Pipeline â€“ Multi-Environment Deployment

## Descritpion

This Jenkins pipeline is designed to execute specific stages based on the environment selected by the user. It supports two distinct environments: PRODUCTION and DEVELOPMENT.

The behavior of the pipeline is controlled by a user-defined parameter called ENVIRONMENT. Depending on the selected value, only the corresponding stage will be executed.
