# Academy DevOps Track 2 Exercises

## Welcome in formazione_sou_k8s

This repository contains the exercises from the second track of the academy that I worked on, along with the tasks requested

### Step1

In the Step1 directory, there is an exercise that runs Jenkins in a Docker container along with a persistent Jenkins agent. This exercise is not fully automated because you need to manually create the agent inside Jenkins. Afterward, you will need to copy and paste the JENKINS_AGENT_NAME and JENKINS_SECRET from Jenkins into the playbook.yaml.
